title: "Meet-O-Matic version 4 bringing better mobile support and privacy"

Some of you may have noticed a few changes in Meet-O-Matic, and that's because 
we have now launched version 4.1. It doesn't sound like much, but we've been doing 
a lot of spring cleaning, and there area whole new set of features and changes
that we'd like to share.

## Mobile friendly

First and foremost, we've completely reworked the whole front end for people
responding to invites, to make the experience better, especially for those 
using devices with smaller screens. We have a lot more ideas to make the experience
still better for everyone, and these will be coming very soon.

## Improved privacy

Along with many sites, we used to use Google Analytics and other tools, partly to
help improve what worked for our customers, and partly to monitor for issues, such
as denial-of-services attacks. However, now we are aligned with [Turalt](https://turalt.com),
we wanted to pur privacy first-and-foremost, so we have now entirely dropped all 
third-party cookies and tracking. We do still use a private monitoring system, but
as of now, every single piece of data from the site is now controlled entirely
by us, and this is our new policy going forwards. 

Again, there will be more coming soon to help with privacy. In particular, in a few 
months we will start to use accounts more, even for free users. This will make it 
easier for you to manage your own data, even if you are using our free service. 

## Improved email notifications

The email notifications are continuing to get better. We've been using a transactional
email service to improve deliverability and appearance for our messages. We still 
get occasional issues with emails going astray, both for people organizing meetings
and responding to them. 

First, in the Settings page, you can now set alternate email addresses. If you 
are organizing a meeting, all notifications get CC'ed to these addresses. Handy if you
need to keep someone in the loop, as well as to 

But this is just the start. Very soon, we'll be notifying organizers of email bounces
and contact updates, directly through the meeting pages.

Meet-O-Matic better for everyone, while still preserving [the vision that
