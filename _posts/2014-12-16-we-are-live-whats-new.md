It’s been a long time coming, but today we finally took the new 
version of Meet-O-Matic live! Take a look for yourself at [meetomatic.com](https:/meetomatic.com).

So what’s new?  Here’s a quick rundown…

**Appointment mode** – This works like hotel, concert or doctor’s appointment 
bookings: firstly, it allows respondents (‘invitees’) to choose only ONE 
date or time slot, and secondly once such a slot is chosen, that chosen 
slot is then disabled for other respondents, thus preventing double-bookings.

**Export responses to Excel, CSV or ICS** – You can now export your meeting 
responses to excel, CSV or ICS formats. This will enable you to import 
dates into your own calendar, or to sort your respondents in a way that 
best suits your requirements; some of users use Meet-O-Matic to schedule 
events with hundreds of participants, so exporting to Excel will make 
managing a large volume of responses  a piece of cake!

**Super-User Admin** – We now have multi-user accounts – great for businesses 
who want a meeting scheduler that doesn’t cost the earth and allows all 
of their employees to schedule their meetings in the simplest way possible!

**New Pricing** – Meet-O-Matic is the cheapest meeting scheduler out there. We 
also offer the most features per $. Go ahead, check out our rivals and 
see if you fancy paying 66%* more for similar features, not to mention 
scheduling which takes longer and has a more klutzy UI (We know, we 
timed it. It typically takes 30 sec – 1 min less time to schedule a
meeting using Meet-O-Matic. Time is money, afterall). We are of course 
still retaining the free version for basic scheduling needs!

Those are the main changes that you’ll notice as a customer (along with 
the new look, which brings the site a bit more up to date). We made some 
backend changes also to enable us to offer a better and more reliable 
service.
