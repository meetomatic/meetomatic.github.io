title: "Can Multitasking Kill You?"
---

It seems pretty unlikely — although mobile phone usage (especially texting)
while driving is indeed a known killer — but there are some remarkable
neuroscience studies that demonstrate precisely why multitasking is really
quite a bad thing.

In a nutshell, the very act of multitasking creates its own neurological ‘buzz’
that makes it feel rewarding and productive, whereas in reality it can be
opposite. But don’t take my word for it, and don’t rely on your own gut
reaction or stories from friends. Read what neuorscientist Daniel J. Levitin
has to say:

> Multitasking has been found to increase the production of the stress hormone
> cortisol as well as the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline, which can
> overstimulate your brain and cause mental fog or scrambled thinking.
> Multitasking creates a dopamine-addiction feedback loop, effectively rewarding
> the brain for losing focus and for constantly searching for external
> stimulation.

Even better, [look at Levitin’s full article in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload?CMP=share_btn_link). 
We thought this
would be of interest to our readers because meeting scheduling and management
is likely to be one of just dozens of tasks you are engaged in during a busy
workday, and you might want to stop and think about marshalling your attention
in a focused manner for just one thing.
