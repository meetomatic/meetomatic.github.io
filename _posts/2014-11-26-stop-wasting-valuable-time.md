In a 2013 article in the McKinsey Quarterly, entitled ‘[Making time management
the organization’s priority](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/making_time_management_the_organizations_priority)‘, authors Frankki Bevins and Aaron De Smet surveyed
1500 executive leaders around the globe, and found that only 9% considered
themselves ‘very satisfied’ with their time management.

This is a remarkable insight – particularly when you consider how much time is
wasted company-wide in the scheduling of meetings (we’ll address this is an
subsequent posting). This may seem obvious to you, but **managers need to get a
grip**!

Are you an effective time manager? If so, what’s your technique? If not, what
are you wasting time on?
