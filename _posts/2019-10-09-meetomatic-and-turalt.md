title: "Meet-O-Matic and Turalt: a brand new future"

Meet-O-Matic is one of the products I am most proud of building, and when, earlier this
year, I had the chance to step back in and take a more direct lead running the service, it was too 
good an opportunity to let pass. 

So now, with my co-founder and the team at [Turalt](https://turalt.com), a privacy-first
company that helps people be more emotionally intelligent and empathic in their
business email communication, we're teaming up to bring many improvements to 
Meet-O-Matic. Some aren't immediately visible, like privacy and security 
enhancements and a new billing system with more self-management for 
Pro users going forward. 

But we are also building in brand new features, and actively working on the 
long-overdue mobile-friendly interface for the whole service,
which will be making an appearance in the coming months. 

We're excited by this opportunity, and we hope you are too. We want to make 
Meet-O-Matic better for everyone, while still preserving [the vision that 
Marc and I had when we started on this journey](https://meetomatic.com/about.php). 

Drop me an email at [stuart.watt@turalt.com](mailto:stuart.watt@turalt.com)
if you have questions about Turalt products and services, or if you have any
suggestions to improve what we're working on at Meet-O-Matic.
