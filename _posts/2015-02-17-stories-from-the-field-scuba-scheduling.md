title: "Stories from the field – Scuba Scheduling"
author: leo

We recently received the following story from Jim Gregory, a long time user of
Meet-O-Matic (10 years!), about how Meet-O-Matic has helped him with varying
scheduling requirements over the years.

> I started using it when I worked for a large corporation that had several
> subsidiaries and didn’t have networked appointment management system for all of
> them. My internal partners loved it. I also used it to reach out set up
> meetings with investment management clients with far flung families. Now, I
> wear several hats and have no central network for any of them. I set up
> meetings for volunteer efforts that I organize. I also design websites for
> Non-Profits that get together for web site useage training.

> Most often, as a scuba instructor, I use Meet-O-Matic to sort out the best time
> for training sessions. I teach private classes for small groups and customize
> the scheduling rather than insisting everyone show up when it’s most convenient
> for me. When I have 5 or 6 students with all of their conflicting time demands
> Meet-O-Matic is invaluable.

We love hearing stories like this, and always find it fascinating to hear the
non-traditional uses people have for a scheduling tool. Not every meeting takes
place in a boardroom!

If you’ve got a story to share with our users then send it in! Every story that
gets published will receive a free upgrade to Meet-O-Matic Pro.

Many thanks to Jim Gregory at [CustomScubaInstruction.com](http://www.customscubainstruction.com/) 
for sending in his story.
