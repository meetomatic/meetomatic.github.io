title: "Coming soon, the all-new Meet-O-Matic!"
---

The end of 2014 is bringing some radical changes to Meet-O-Matic that we’re
really excited to tell you about! We believe that simplicity is key for a
meeting scheduler, it’s what we’re all about and is what makes using Meet-O-Matic
quicker than other schedulers.

Over the years we’ve strived to retain this ease-of-use that our users love.
However, we’re sure you’ll agree that Meet-O-Matic could do with a refresh.

## What are we so excited about?

We’ve been working hard to figure out how to bring Meet-O-Matic up to date, while
adding some brilliant new features without compromising on the simplicity that
we’re known for.

This re-design will be only our third iteration since launch way back in ’98,
and it’s going to be the most radical to date. This blog should give you a
little teaser of the new look; we’ll be announcing the full details very soon.
In the meantime, why not follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meetomatic) for regular tips and updates (and
even special offers when we go live)!

We can’t wait to share it with you.

-Leo, on behalf of the Meet-O-Matic Team
