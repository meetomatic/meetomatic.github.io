user settings. This enables you to quickly schedule meeting which happen at the
same time each week, such as book groups, team meetings etc…

You can also quickly select multiple dates by clicking on either the day name,
the month name, or the “>” at the side of the calendar.

**Step 4:** Click ‘Go!’ and invite your participants

It’s that simple!
