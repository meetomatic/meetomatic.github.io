## Setting up a meeting with Meet-O-Matic really is as easy as 1, 2, 3!

1. Select the dates/times that you want your participants to choose from, 
then click “Go!”

2. You’ll receive a link that you can forward onto your chosen respondents. 
They’ll be directed to a response form to select what times they are 
available

3. When everyone has responded, Meet-O-Matic will ‘rank’ the responses to 
show you which date is the most suitable for your meeting. You then let 
each participant know which date is the most suitable! You can choose 
“VIP” participants if some absolutely has to be there, and if you’re 
organising a really large event, you can export the responses to Excel, 
CSV or ICS formats for easy integration with your calendar!

It’s as simple as that!
